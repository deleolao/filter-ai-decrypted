# Decrypted TensorFlow model files from Deledao's AI powered web filter
Extracted from the Hapara Filter extension (which is just a rebranded version of Deledao's filter)

# Whats the point of this
You can make your own free web filter that's just as powerful as Deledao's paid and proprietary one

Idk this is actually pretty useless on its own, you would need the filter source code as well (Coming soon!) to do anything useful.

# omg this is so proprietary and people are supposed to pay for it! take it down now!
Too bad for deledao agents i guess, maybe obfuscate your "InstantAI technology" better next time.

This was actually trivially easy to pull off. The decryption keys weren't even scrambled.

# Notes

- This filter is easy to circumvent with a cloaking web proxy (Won't give away details for deledao agents, sorry.)

## What are the subdirectories for?

`GMmodel-enc` contains the model files for the "GameChanger" AI.
- This analyzes keystrokes for game playing activity.
- Game makers take note: Unconventional game controls can circumvent this.

`IAmodel-enc` contains the model files for the "MediaMonitor" AI.
- This scans text and images for "inappropriate" content.
